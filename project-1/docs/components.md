## 1. `.ebextensions/python.config`

**Purpose**: This file contains configuration options for your Elastic Beanstalk environment, specifically for Python applications.

**Key components**:
- **WSGIPath**: Specifies the main entry point for your application (`application:application`), telling Elastic Beanstalk where to find the WSGI application object.
- **FLASK_ENV**: Sets the Flask environment to 'production', which disables debug features for security and performance.
- **Static files mapping**: Configures the proxy to serve static files directly from the `/static` directory.
- **Package installation**: Installs necessary system packages (`python3-devel` and `gcc`) during deployment for compiling dependencies.

**How to modify**:
- Change `WSGIPath` if your application entry point is different
- Add environment variables under the `aws:elasticbeanstalk:application:environment` section
- Add more static file mappings as needed
- Include additional system packages required by your application

**Example modification** (adding a database URL environment variable):
```yaml
option_settings:
  aws:elasticbeanstalk:container:python:
    WSGIPath: application:application
  aws:elasticbeanstalk:application:environment:
    FLASK_ENV: production
    DATABASE_URL: mysql://user:password@localhost/dbname
```

## 2. `.gitignore`

**Purpose**: Prevents unnecessary or sensitive files from being committed to your Git repository and included in deployments.

**Key components**:
- **Elastic Beanstalk files**: Ignores EB configuration files except for specific allowed ones
- **Python-specific entries**: Excludes bytecode, cache files, and build directories
- **Virtual environment**: Prevents the local virtual environment from being committed
- **IDE and OS files**: Excludes editor-specific and operating system files

**How to modify**:
- Add project-specific files or directories that should not be versioned
- Add sensitive configuration files (like those containing credentials)
- Include additional build artifacts that your deployment process might generate

**Example modification** (adding a local config file):
```
# Local configuration
config.local.json
secrets.json
```

## 3. `application.py`

**Purpose**: The main entry point for your Flask application, which Elastic Beanstalk will execute.

**Key components**:
- **Application initialization**: Creates the Flask application instance named `application` (this specific name is required by Elastic Beanstalk)
- **Route definitions**: Defines the web endpoints `/`, `/health`, and `/api/info`
- **Health check endpoint**: The `/health` endpoint is used by Elastic Beanstalk to determine if your application is running correctly
- **Development server**: Code to run the application directly for local testing

**How to modify**:
- Add more routes to expand your application's functionality
- Connect to databases or other AWS services
- Add authentication and authorization
- Implement application logic and business rules
- Modify the health check to include more comprehensive checks

**Example modification** (adding a database connection):
```python
from flask import Flask, render_template, jsonify
import boto3
import os

application = Flask(__name__)

# Connect to DynamoDB
dynamodb = boto3.resource('dynamodb')
table = dynamodb.Table(os.environ.get('DYNAMODB_TABLE'))

@application.route('/api/items')
def get_items():
    response = table.scan()
    return jsonify(items=response['Items'])

# Existing routes...
```

## 4. `instructions.md`

**Purpose**: A guide for developers on how to deploy the application to AWS Elastic Beanstalk.

**Key components**:
- **Prerequisites**: Needed before starting deployment
- **Local testing**: How to test the application locally
- **Deployment preparation**: Creating a ZIP file for upload
- **Deployment steps**: Detailed steps for using the AWS console
- **Application management**: How to view logs, monitor, configure, update, and terminate your environment
- **Troubleshooting**: Common issues and solutions


## 5. `requirements.txt`

**Purpose**: Specifies the Python package dependencies for your application, which Elastic Beanstalk will install during deployment.

**Key components**:
- **Flask**: The web framework
- **Werkzeug**: WSGI utility library used by Flask
- **Jinja2**: Template engine for rendering HTML
- **boto3**: AWS SDK for Python, allowing interaction with AWS services

**How to modify**:
- Add additional packages needed by your application
- Update version numbers for security or compatibility
- Specify exact versions to ensure consistent deployments
- Group and comment packages for better organization

**Example modification** (adding database and form handling):
```
# Web Framework
Flask==2.3.3
Werkzeug==2.3.7
Jinja2==3.1.2

# AWS SDK
boto3==1.28.38

# Database
SQLAlchemy==2.0.19
psycopg2-binary==2.9.7

# Forms & Validation
Flask-WTF==1.1.1
WTForms==3.0.1

# Security
Flask-Login==0.6.2
```

## 6. `templates/index.html`

**Purpose**: The HTML template for the main page of your application, rendered by Flask.

**Key components**:
- **Basic HTML structure**: Standard HTML5 document
- **Inline CSS**: Styles for formatting the page
- **Content sections**: Information about the application
- **API links**: References to the available endpoints

**How to modify**:
- Update the design and styling
- Add more content or interactive elements
- Include JavaScript for dynamic behavior
- Link to external stylesheets
- Add forms for user input
- Create a more comprehensive UI

**Example modification** (adding a form and JavaScript):
```html
<!-- Add in the head section -->
<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.0.min.js"></script>
<script>
    $(document).ready(function() {
        $('#checkHealth').click(function() {
            $.get('/health', function(data) {
                $('#healthResult').text(JSON.stringify(data));
            });
        });
    });
</script>

<!-- Add in the body -->
<div class="form-section">
    <h2>Test API Endpoints</h2>
    <button id="checkHealth">Check Health</button>
    <div id="healthResult" class="result"></div>
</div>
```
